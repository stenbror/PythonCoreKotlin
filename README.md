# PythonCoreKotlin
This is the start of a Roslyn like parser / analyzer for Python 3.8 ( Soon 3.10 ) grammar. Parser is now undergoing UnitTest coverage to make sure it is parsing correctly. Next step will be the tokenizer.
Everything is written in Kotlin under Java for now, but might be native in the future.
